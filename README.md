## Code folder 

The code folder contains the R markdown generated for this paper. In there, there are 10 sections: 

* How to install all packages 
* How to activate the packages
* Enter and quality control the genotypic data
* Visualize the phylogeny-based hierarchical distribution of genotypes (Figure 1)
* Visualize the frequency-based distribution of hierarhical genotypes (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S1)
* Assess the distribution of STs across BAPS1 sub-groups or haplotypes(Figure 3)
* Assess the distrubiton of AMR loci across STs (Figure 4)
* Integrative visualization of phylogenetic tree, hierarchical genotypes, and distribution of AMR loci (Figure 5)
* Assessment of cgMLST variant distribution across ST lineages (Supplementary Figure S2)
* Assessment of the genetic diversity across STs using the Simpson's D index of diversity across genotypic layers (Supplementary Figure S3)
* Assessment of the genetic diversity across STs using the distribution of BAPS1-6 sub-groups or haplotypes (Supplementary Figure S4)
